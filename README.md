## Project Overview

**Share Media** is a simple yet powerful file-sharing system that allows users to upload images and generate a unique download link. This link can be shared with anyone, allowing them to download the uploaded image from anywhere in the world.

Whether you're sharing personal photos, work-related images, or media files, Share Media provides a quick and efficient way to make your files accessible to others.

### Key Features:
- **Image Uploading:** Users can easily upload their images to the platform.
- **Link Generation:** Each uploaded file generates a unique URL that can be shared for downloading.
- **Global Access:** The download link can be accessed and used anywhere with internet connectivity.
- **Simple UI:** Clean and user-friendly interface for ease of use.
